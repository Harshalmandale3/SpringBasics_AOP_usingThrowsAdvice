# Spring Basics AOP using Throws Advice
Throws advice is a type of pointcut advice in Spring AOP that allows the user to configure a piece of code to be executed when a method throws an exception. 
This type of advice can be used to perform logging, transaction management, and other necessary tasks when an exception is thrown.
The advantage of using throws advice is that it can be used to apply a consistent behavior across multiple methods, regardless of the exception that is thrown. 
Additionally, the user can configure the exception type for which the advice should be applied.
